## Structure your posts

Use level 2 (`##`) and if necessary level 3 (`###`) titles
to structure your posts.

## Display code snippets

You can display a block of code like the following using triple backticks.
You can also specify the language after the first triple backticks.

```Perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
```

## Add images

Create an `assets` folder where you can put all your images,
then display them with a link starting with an exclamative mark like this:
`![my image]({{ "/assets/sample-image.jpg" | relative_url }})`.

![my image]({{ "/assets/sample-image.jpg" | relative_url }})
